# Demo Marketplace Microservices

This project includes three microservices:
- **Account Service** (`account-service`)
- **Marketplace Service** (`marketplace-service`)
- **Wallet Service** (`wallet-service`)

These services are built with Spring Boot and Akka Cluster (for marketplace service) and can be run **locally** or using **Docker**.

## üìö Notes
- Marketplace service uses **Akka Cluster Sharding** internally.
- Running two instances of marketplace service (ports 8083 and 8084) enables **cluster node communication**.
- The HTTP server inside marketplace-service listens on port **8081** (for client requests).
- Use provided `products.xlsx` file to initialize products (required inside marketplace-service resources).
